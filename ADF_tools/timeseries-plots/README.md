### ADF Time Series via Jupyter Notebook and YAML File
---

This is a collection of notebooks, which generate time series for a specific set of variables, but can be altered to taste. 

This is a special subset diagnostic tool of the ADF.

* ```Time_Series_Annual``` notebook focuses on RESTOM, TS, SST, and ICEFRAC for the Labrador Sea, averaged globally and annually.

* ```Time_Series_Seasonal``` notebook will go through seasonal averaging of variables.

Along with the notebooks is a config YAML file that points to sample data located on ```glade``` so that the variables can quickly be explored. Modify this YAML file to start using your own runs!
